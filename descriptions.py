Initially they constructed the unique Underwater Observatory Tower, which today consists of two adjoining towers, \n
the first erected in 1974 and the second larger one, in 1991. \n
With no nets around the towers to keep the fish and marine creatures close by, all our marine life come and live by \n

walking path that crosses the river on one bridge and returns via the other bridge. The first bridge can be reached \n
by an easy, unpaved path along the northern bank of the stream; this is a 10 minute walk. One can also actually cross \n
the river bed itself and walk to the bridge on the slope of the southern bank, in the heart of nature. This path \n
offers forest foliage as well as views of the stream and the green slopes of the Carmel, and takes about a half hour.

and head in the direction of the sea. This part, which hugs the coast, is the Shikmona Nature Reserve, the loveliest \n
part of Haifa’s coastline. This stretch of the coast was declared a nature reserve in 2008 partly due to its unique \n
reef made up of a kind of gastropod that acts as a habitat for sea creatures and is unique to the eastern \n
Mediterranean. Plant species, some of which are rare, grow on the coast, such as the evening primrose, which blooms \n
just before sunset, and the limonium that covers the coastline in a carpet of purple in the spring. Tel Shikmona, \n
one of the most interesting archaeological sites in Israel, is situated in the northern part of the nature reserve. \n
Settled during the 15th century BCE, the site consists of ruins and a mosaic floor. Findings from the site are on \n

Givat Ram, Gan Sacher is the largest green space in Jerusalem. \n
The expanse of grass is large enough that it only gets crowded during a concert, or when thousands of Israeli \n
revelers converge on the park en masses for the annual Independence Day grill fest. The trees on the edges of the \n
grass provide sufficient shade for a sprawling picnic spread, while the un-shaded areas are large enough to support a \n
game of ultimate Frisbee. \n
More activity-specific facilities include basketball courts, soccer pitches, tennis courts, a bike path (which \n

located from the Greek Orthodox Church in order to safeguard its preservation as public open space. The park’s design \n
by Ulrik Plessner was intended to be an organic extension of the open spaces surrounding the Old City to the east. \n
The garden incorporates the family tomb of King Herod and remains of an ancient aqueduct. The park includes lawns, \n
play areas and a fountain. Benches, drinking fountains (including Gwendoline’s Fountain for dogs), bathrooms and \n
flower beds have been added over the years. In 1996, the garden was renovated and the Israel Bonds Tribute Site, \n
which includes a time capsule, was created at the park.

    'Rabinovich Park':
'''
The Rabinovitch Park is located at a prominent intersection in Kiryat Hayovel. The park’s central feature is The \n
Golem, a monumental play sculpture by French-American artist Niki de St. Phalle (1930-2002). The vividly painted, \n
two-story monster head with tongue slides is a Jerusalem landmark, known simply as The Monster. Children climb up an \n
exterior stairway, enter a small dark room, then slide down through the monster’s gaping mouth. Dr. Martin Weyl, \n
former director of the Israel Museum and former art advisor to mayor Teddy Kollek recalls that the mayor was to have \n
inaugurated the sculpture by sliding down one of the tongues, but he couldn’t get up the ladder because of the crush \n
of children. In an interview held in connection with an exhibit of St. Phalle’s at the Pompidou Center in Paris in \n
1980, the artist stated that the sculpture was the work of which is she was most proud.

    'Ramat Gan National Park':

Ramat Gan National Park is a large urban park in the Tel Aviv District city of Ramat Gan, Israel. It is not \n
actually a national park. The initiator of the idea of setting up the park was the first mayor of Ramat Gan Avraham \n
Krinitzi who actively promoted the idea. Krinitzi advocated for setting it in the southern part of the city. He is \n
also buried there with his wife and driver, who all died in a car accident together on their way back from the city \n
of Acre, where he was also the Mayor at the time. \n
The planting began in February 1951 and the park opened to the public in 1953. In 1959, an artificial lake was \n
created, which was enlarged throughout the years. \n
The park covers an area of 1.9 km2. It is the second largest urban park in Israel, after the Yarkon Park. The park \n

    'Park Darom':

Some people lament the fact that The Yarkon Park which runs along the tiny Yarkon River is the only real Park in \n
Tel Aviv.  Yes, Park HaYarkon is large and sprawling, yes it's great for cycling, and I definitely do enjoy all of \n
the attractions there - but it just doesn't keep out the city like the great city parks do. You still hear the \n
traffic, see the tall buildings tower over most of the trees and you definitely feel the "dinkiness" of it. Plus, \n
its SO far from so much of the city! \n
Most visitors write this off to the fact that the city's entire western border of Tel Aviv is the beach- a public \n
park in and of itself, making it unnecessary to ensure that the Yarkon Park is something truly spectacular. But what \n
most people, even Tel Aviv residents, don't know is that there is another a large, grassy Tel Aviv park that is \n
super-awesome- it's just not smack dab in the center. \n
This is Park Darom and it is one of the hidden gems of Tel Aviv. The park is extremely well kempt, with the grass \n
always mowed and watered, and the paths always safe and clean. In fact, the park even has its own website that you \n
can check out here which showcases all of the activities, attractions and great things about the park. Don't worry, \n
since the site is all in Hebrew I won't leave you hanging.

    'Independence Park':
'''
Independence Park is a large green area in the center of Jerusalem, bounded by King George Street to the West, \n
Agron Street to the south, Hillel Street to the north and the old Mamilla Cemetery to the east. During the time of \n
the British Mandate, the Park was an open area that served as a barrier between the Jewish city center and the \n
upscale Arab neighborhoods to the south. After Jerusalem was partitioned in the 1948 War of Independence, the nascent \n
Israeli government decided that the area would become a green area; thus Independence Park was established in 1959. \n
During the daylight hours, the Park mostly serves the many people who work in the center of town and like to have \n
their lunches outside. Families from around the area come to hang out, picnic and kick a ball around, \n
and young people can often be spotted leisurely sipping beers in the shade of the large pine trees. But like its \n
namesake park in Tel-Aviv, after night falls, under a thick blanket of darkness, Independence Park becomes a \n
rendezvous spot for members of Jerusalem’s gay community. It is this function that has made the Park a convergence \n
point for many LGBT events, including the annual gay pride parade. Other events held at Independence Park include the \n
yearly Student’s Day celebrations when thousands turn out to enjoy live music performances.

the heart of the Arbel Nature Reserve, declared in 1967, and the national park that surrounds it, which also includes \n
Mt Nitai, Mt Savyon, the Horns of Hittim, and the Arbel Plateau. \n
The main importance of the nature reserve and the reason for its declaration is preservation of the diversity of \n
habitats it contains and the unique species that inhabit it, as well as the fact that it is part of a continuum of \n
natural areas, allowing wildlife to pass between them. In addition, the site was declared a nature reserve in order \n
to restore and conserve the fascinating heritage sites and antiquities found at Arbel. These sites include Arbel \n
Fortress and the impressive cave village, where historic battles were fought in the days of Herod, Horvat Vradim\n

synagogue are still to be seen.

    'Kfar Nahum National Park':
'''
The synagogue that visitors see today was in use during the Byzantine period. An earlier synagogue also stood \n
here; scholars are divided over whether it was built in the third or the fourth century CE. \n
A very exciting site for Christian pilgrims is one that started out in the first century CE as a dwelling. The floor \n
of one of the rooms was covered with white plaster and its walls were adorned with plaster painted with geometric \n
patterns and colorful flowers. Apparently as early as the first century the building served as a gathering place for \n
the first Christians (Judeo-Christians). Discovered at the site were 173 plaster fragments bearing inscriptions, \n
mostly in Greek. Some, like “our Lord”, “the Nazarene”, “the greatest of all” and “Simon”, attest to the existence of \n
a Christian community. \n
In the fourth century the assembly room in the private dwelling became a small public structure. In the middle of the \n
fifth century the site was leveled and an octagonal church was built on top, with the original room right in the \n
center. A larger octagon was built around the inner one, with a mosaic floor bearing floral decorations. Christian \n
pilgrims of the sixth century mention the church, noting that it was built over the house of the Apostle Peter. A \n
modern church stands over the site today.

A musical fountain, also known as a dancing fountain, is a type of animated fountain for entertainment purposes \n

light, and in doing so, three-dimensional images can be produced. \n
Installations can be large scale, employing hundreds of water jets and lights, and costing into the millions of \n
dollars, or in smaller household forms, where a budget of one thousand dollars is feasible. Musical features tend to \n
be complex, and require a degree of mechanical, hydraulic, electrical, and electronic components out of view that \n
